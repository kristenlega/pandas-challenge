Github affected the rendering of a few of the dataframes, so please feel free to use nbviewer to correctly view the output: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kristenlega/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_final.ipynb


### Observations
1. Despite MUCH lower levels of total and per student funding, Charter schools perform better in terms of grades in all capacities. All top 5 performing schools are Charter schools, while all 5 bottom school are District. This may be due to more freedom in terms of curriculum, management, etc.

2. Students at smaller schools perform better across the board in terms of grades. This may also explain the discrepancy between the school types, as Charter schools tend to be much smaller than District schools and may result in more attention and better resources per student.

3. Grades for both Math and Reading did not seem to have any significant trend or change between each grade level. However, students as a whole tended to do better in Reading than Math.



### Instructions

- The Ask: Analyze district-wide standardized test results. Aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
- Provided: access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.

The final report should include the following:

District Summary - Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
- Total Schools
- Total Students
- Total Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

School Summary - Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) - Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) - Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.


Math Scores by Grade - Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


Reading Scores by Grade - Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


Scores by School Spending - Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Scores by School Size - Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

Scores by School Type - Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
